# Image Classification and Style Transfer

Pytorch implementation of the joint task of image classification and style transfer, where [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) is the source domain and [CARLA](http://carla.org/), [GTA5 Dataset](https://download.visinf.tu-darmstadt.de/data/from_games/) and Van-Gogh images are target domains respectively.

## Training model for image classification
```
python cifar_train.py

```
To train classifiers with different datasets, specify the dataroot of the corresponding dataset.
